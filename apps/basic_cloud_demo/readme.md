### Certificate Infrastructure 

The provided GitBash Shell scripts enable easy creation of certificate infrastructure and individual device certificates with very minimal user inputs.

These scripts are based on the Azure's [Create and Upload Certificates for Testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/tutorial-x509-test-certs?tabs=windows) tutorial.
